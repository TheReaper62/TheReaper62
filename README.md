## 👋 Hi, I’m @TheReaper62,

👀 I’m interested and specialise in Backend Development.
For Example Form Data Handling, Comprehension of Open Ended Answers, etc.

## Bot Development
Need to Set up a **Discord** Bot for your server with custom functions? Need to integrate Google Spreadsheets?
I can help you do up a bot with functions as you request. Google Spreadsheets can be enabled to be a database or a more scalable production level database such as Firebase or Supabase, if you plan on storing/display user data.
