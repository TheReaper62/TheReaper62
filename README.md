## 👋 Hi, I’m @TheReaper62, *you can call me Joel*

👀 I’m interested and specialise in Backend Development.
For Example Form Data Handling, Comprehension of Open Ended Answers, etc.

## Bot Development
Need to Set up a **Discord** Bot for your server with custom functions? Need to integrate Google Spreadsheets?
I can help you do up a bot **Free of Charge** with functions as you request. Google Spreadsheets can be enabled to be a database 
if you plan on storing/display user data.

# About me

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Bot Development *(E.g. Discord Bot)* or any Google Form Data that needs validation/computation/modification.
